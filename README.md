# FlashCard-Generator

An application that will generate and let you study flashcards. The user has the choice of making two types of flashcards, basic and cloze.
Basic flashcards will prompt the user for a question to input, and then an answer on the back. A cloze card will prompt the user for a statement,
and then a word that they would like removed from the statement. The removed word will be on the back as the answer, and the statement with the missing word
will appear on the front as the question.

You must create at least two flashcards before you can study!
